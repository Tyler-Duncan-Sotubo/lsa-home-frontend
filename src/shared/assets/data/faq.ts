      <p>Both pillows are designed to have a similar feel; the major difference lies in the material of the filling.</p>
      <p>Goose down pillows are plump and fluffy pillows filled with the under-feathers (down) of goose, while down alternative pillows are filled with hollow fibre to mimic the fluffiness of down pillows.</p>
      <p>Down alternative pillows are a perfect choice for those prone to allergies as some sleepers may react to down. They are also a less pricey option than goose down.</p>

      <p>Avoid washing your goose down pillows in a domestic washing machine; spot clean small stains with mild soap.</p>
      <p>If you have large stains that have to be washed, have the pillows dry cleaned, but note that dry cleaning your goose down pillows may shorten their lifespan as the chemicals will remove the pillow’s natural oils and make it break down faster.</p>
      <p>To prevent stains, use protectors.</p>
      <p><strong>Down alternative pillows:</strong></p>
      <p>Spot clean small stains on your down alternative pillows and dry clean for large stains. Down alternative pillows can be dry cleaned as much as required.</p>

      <p>It may take about 2 weeks for the pillows to take their original shape, so don’t be too worried if they seem a little flat minutes after taking them out of the bag.</p>

      <p>We recommend having your duvets dry cleaned instead of washing them at home.</p>
      <p>Domestic washing machines are not large enough for duvets, and when duvets get wet, they tend to get very heavy which will make them difficult to handle.</p>
      <p>To enable your duvets last longer, we recommend using duvet covers so you wash your covers more and duvets less. Duvet covers also offer styling options as they come in different colours and designs.</p>

      <p>Our sheets are made with 100% cotton and are not treated with any anti-wrinkle chemicals; therefore they are prone to wrinkles.</p>
      <p>However, with subsequent uses and washes, your sheets will wrinkle less.</p>
      <p>Line drying your sheets can prevent significant wrinkling. When using a dryer, bring them out before they are completely dry and lay flat to dry.</p>

    question: "Are the candles safe?",
    answer: `
      <p>All the candles we retail are made from soy wax so they are natural and non-toxic. They also burn longer, cleaner, and completely.</p>
      <p>Here are some safety precautions to guide you when using scented candles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Never leave a lit candle burning unattended.</li>
        <li>Keep burning candles away from children, pets, and anything that can catch fire.</li>
        <li>To avoid a hazard and to prevent the glass from breaking, always discontinue use and discard your candle when ½&quot; wax remains.</li>
        <li>Always use a candle holder or plate specifically designed for candle use. It should be heat resistant, sturdy, and large enough to contain any drips or melted wax.</li>
        <li>Never burn a candle for more than 2 to 3 hours at a time.</li>
        <li>Never move or handle a burning candle. Extinguish and allow to fully cool after or in between use.</li>
        <li>Place the candle and candle holder on a stable, flat surface.</li>
        <li>Trim wicks to ¼&quot; or less before each use. Extinguish immediately, allow to cool, and trim further if black smoke appears.</li>
        <li>Do not burn candles where there is a draft, as it may cause sooting and uneven burning.</li>
        <li>Burn candles in well-ventilated rooms.</li>
        <li>Never burn a candle when the wick is not in the center of the wax.</li>
        <li>Keep the melt pool free of wick trimmings, matches, and debris at all times.</li>
      </ul>

    category: "Fragrances",
    question: "How do I care for my scented candles?",
    answer: `
      <p>For best results, trim the wick to ¼&quot; before each use.</p>
      <p>Always try to burn your candles for about 2 hours at a time. This allows a warm wax pool to develop that fully releases the fragrance and helps prevent tunnelling.</p>
      <p>If you see a mushroom-like ball form at the top of the wick, don’t be alarmed – just trim it off as part of the normal trimming process.</p>
      <p>The more concentrated the fragrance oils used to make the candle, the more this occurs. It is normal with complex, high-quality scents.</p>
      <p>Always light your candles a full two hours before your guests arrive so the fragrance can fully envelop the room.</p>

    question: "What are reed diffusers?",
    answer: `
      <p>Diffusers are the flameless alternative for constant fragrance.</p>
      <p>The diffusers we offer come with natural rattan reeds which slowly soak up the fragrance oil and then dispel it into the air.</p>

    question: "What are the best practices for reed diffusers?",
    answer: `
      <ul>
        <li>If you like more fragrance in the room, discreetly place more than one diffuser in the room, or carefully remove and reverse the direction of the reeds.</li>
        <li>Be careful when flipping reeds – if you drip oil onto a finished surface, it could cause damage. Do it over a sink or protected surface.</li>
        <li>Use a fragrance diffuser on a side table or in a bookshelf to give height near photo frames, books and other items.</li>
        <li>Look for areas where subtle drafts can carry the fragrance and waft it across the room, such as near a ceiling fan or open window.</li>
        <li>Use fragrance diffusers when it isn’t practical to have an open flame.</li>

    category: "Fragrances",
    question: "What kind of fragrance is best for open rooms?",
    answer: `
      <p>Citrus and floral fragrances are good for open, airy and large rooms and typically take fewer reeds to create the desired effect.</p>
      <p>Wood notes and resins are amazing too but often require more than one candle burning at a time or more reeds in diffusers to create the ambiance you are looking for.</p>
