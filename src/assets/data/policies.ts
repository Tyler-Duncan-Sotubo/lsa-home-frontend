  `<h2>Consent</h2>
  <h3>How Do You Get My Consent?</h3>
  <p>When you provide us with Personal Information to complete a transaction, verify your payment method, place an order, arrange for a delivery, or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific purpose only.</p>
  <p>If we ask for your Personal Information for a secondary purpose, such as marketing, we will either ask you directly for your explicit consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.</p>
  <h3>How Do I Withdraw My Consent?</h3>

  <p>We will retain your Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (for example, for tax, accounting, or legal reporting requirements).</p>
  <p>When we no longer have an ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible, then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>`,

  `<h2>How We Keep Your Information Safe</h2>
  <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect the security of any Personal Information we process. However, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and therefore we cannot promise or guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly access, steal, or modify your information.</p>
  <p>Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Information, transmission of Personal Information to and from our Site is at your own risk. You should only access our Site within a secure environment.</p>`,

  `<h2>Do Not Track</h2>
  <p>Some browsers offer a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signal which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites requesting that your browsing not be tracked.
